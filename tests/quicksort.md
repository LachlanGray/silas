> Some of the jars were broken, but I still had enough good ones for all my spices. Pretty labels and jars.
> It looks nice , the only thing the I wasn't happy about it that the stickers are not laminated.
> The product dimensions are wrong in the description. It says 1.4 inches wide and it is more like 1.69
> Itâ€™s 23 for 26$ not worth I will return it rather just buy some other ones
> Clean. Very nice to look at. I love it!!
> Completely reorganized the spice cupboard. These jars and labels were easy to use and fill. Still going strong after several months of use.
> Sturdy and well made
> Horrible. Just horrible.
